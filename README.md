# What is Global Forest Watch?

[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) is a
dynamic online forest monitoring and alert system that empowers people
everywhere to better manage forests. This repository contains the GFW web app.

# Getting started

The GFW web app is built with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Installing the app

Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw.git
```

Installing dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env.local`, and start the server:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

The app should now be accessible on [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000).

## Developing

We follow a [Gitflow Worklow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development and deployment. Our `master` branch goes to production, `develop` goes to `master`. We also have a staging branch which is detached from the workflow that can be used to merge multiple branches for deployment to the staging site. Additionally you can deploy `develop` or feature branches to staging if desired.

## Releases

We are using github releases to record changes to the app. To help us manage this we are using [Zeit Releases](https://github.com/zeit/release), an npm package for handling github releases, tagging commits (major, minor, patch), and automating semantic release logs. For a more detailed explanation of semantic changelogs see [this post](https://semver.org/).


#### Managing commits for a release

When developing, you can tag your commits as follows: `fix some excellent bug (patch)` where `patch` can be `(major/minor/patch/ignore)`. This commit title will automatically be grouped into the correct section for the release. Otherwise you will be prompted during the release to assign (or ignore) each of your commits. You will have to do this for every commit so don't forget to squash!

So how do you make a release on GFW?

1. Checkout master and merge in develop (not compulsory but advised for consistency).
2. Run `npx release [type]` where type can be `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `pre` (see [zeit docs](https://github.com/zeit/release) for more details).
3. Follow the prompts to manage commits.
4. You will be taken to github draft release editor with all your commits grouped and ready to go.
5. Enter your title and include any extra info you want.
6. Publish!

# RW API Documentation for GFW

Map layers and relevant datasets are stored in the [RW-API](http://api.resourcewatch.org/) and the `globalforestwatch.org/map` utilises the [layer-manager](https://github.com/Vizzuality/layer-manager) to render them.

The schema used to style these layers, their legends, and define their interactions are specific to the *Global Forest Watch* platform.

When creating or modifying layers/datasets for GFW, follow the schema and syntax outlined in the [API Documentation](./docs/API_Documentation.md) markdown file.

To view GFW-specific layers and datasets use the following endpoint:

https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset?app=gfw&includes=layer,vocabulary,metadata&page[size]=200

### BrowserStack

We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to find and fix cross-browser issues.
